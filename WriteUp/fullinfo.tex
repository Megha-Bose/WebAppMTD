\section{High Information}\label{sec:high-info}
In this section, we consider a scenario where the defender fully knows the vulnerabilities of every configuration that they deploy, the number of attackers and the reward that the defender would get when an attacker attacks a vulnerability. At every time step, we observe what vulnerability was attacked, which attacker attacked it and the reward obtained. The only two things the defender does not know is the strategy of the attacker and the probability distribution across attacker types. Since we do not know the probability distribution among the attackers, we assume the attackers are chosen adversarially. This setting corresponds to an older application where enough research has been done to determine the vulnerabilities of each configuration that is being deployed and past data about attacks has helped determine the different kinds of attackers who are trying to exploit vulnerabilities in this software and the damage they can do.

When the rewards $r(\psi, e, c)$ are constant for each attacker, vulnerability and configuration tuple, then we can model this as a repeated game against a {\em master} attacker who chooses both an attacker and a vulnerability. \textbf{Need to figure this out}.
